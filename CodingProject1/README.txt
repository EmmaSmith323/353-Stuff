Compiling instructions - 
Add all files, including images and logs, to the same folder. Execute make command.
When doing a make clean, it will remove all *.txt files so be careful if they are in the folder.

I struggled with this assignment... 
So my work for the first part does work, the second part should work but I had difficulties testing due to environment problems that I will deal with before the next assignment. Part 3 just has the framework of how to fork set up but I do not think it actually work and never implemented getting images from the path rather than the filename itself. 
I relied heavily on Beej's Guide to Network Programming and quite a few stackoverflow question to get my code working, so please do not count as plagerism. (I do not have the exact links to stackoverflows....)
